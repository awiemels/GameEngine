The idea behind the game is that you have disturbed a grave 
and triggered the wrath of a ghost, the ghost tries to approach you 
to posess you. You have a flashlight that can defend against the ghost
but the flashlight has limited power.

I made the game in pycharm using pygame. To run the program, 
you simply need to open a new pycharm project put the main file 
and pngs into the pycharm project. Make sure pygame is installed 
than it is included in the interpreter under settings for the project
and run the program

The program dependencies are pygame as the game engine is coded using
that library, python math library as the distance function used to test
for collisions requires the square root function from math. Also, the
pngs files are needed to actually show the sprites.
